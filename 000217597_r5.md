# Report 5: Orchestrating Data/ML Workflows at Scale With Netflix Maestro

The article focuses on introducing Maestro as a workflow orchestrator developed by Netflix to meet the current and future needs of the company in managing data and machine learning workflows at scale. Moreover, it discusses the challenges faced with the existing orchestrator, the motivation behind developing Maestro, and the features and benefits of using Maestro for orchestrating workflows. 

Moreover, the paper effectively illustrates the benefits of Maestro using visuals like images and diagrams, making it accessible for new readers and users that are recently beginning to learn about machine learning. It notably presents Maestro's workflow as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure with clear diagrams and easy-to-read typography, enhancing understanding. Additionally, it explains how Maestro supports multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs) such as YAML, Python, and Java, highlighting the coding structure and how workflow differs based on the chosen language. Nevertheless, one potential weakness of the article is the frequent use of abbreviations common in academia and machine learning may pose a challenge for new users navigating the realm of orchestrators.

It is important to mention that this document contributes to advancing knowledge in the field of data and machine learning workflow orchestration by providing insights into the development and implementation of a scalable, reliable, and user-friendly workflow orchestrator like Maestro, which can serve as a valuable reference for organizations around the world. In fact, it presents Netflix’s scalability challenges with their existing orchestrator and introduces Maestro as a solution designed for horizontal scaling,n providing insights into effective large-scale workflow management.

A valuable next step in advancing the orchestration of data and ML workflows at scale could involve conducting comparative studies between Netflix’s Maestro and other widely used workflow orchestrators in the industry. By evaluating factors such as scalability, usability, and performance, new investigations could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different orchestrator solutions.
