⮚ What is the research question of the article?

This study seeks to create a dependable model for forecasting prices by employing machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing methods.

⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The document showcases several strengths. It employs a variety of techniques to achieve optimal results in terms of Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R2 score. Specifically, it utilizes diverse machine learning techniques such as linear regression, tree-based models, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and neural networks, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to model building. Furthermore, the paper incorporates sentiment analysis from customer reviews as a feature in the price prediction model. The authors acknowledge the importance of qualitative feedback in determining property prices on platforms like Airbnb by leveraging sentiment analysis of customer reviews.

However, there are some weaknesses. One notable weakness is the lack of detailed information about the data sources. The authors do not provide enough information about the source, size, and quality of the data used, which could impact the reliability and significance of the results. Additionally, the document does not thoroughly explore the implementation of the machine learning models or sentiment analysis techniques, missing an opportunity to offer insights into the practical aspects of the study.

⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
(If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided
publish the article).


This paper makes a significant contribution by exploring various feature selection techniques, integrating Neural Networks, and using sentiment analysis from customer reviews. As stated by the authors, the last two contributions are unique in rental price prediction, as they haven't been seen before in existing literature.

⮚ What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

According to the authors, future directions for this study could involve (exploring additional feature selection methods like Random Forest feature importance and conducting further experiments with different neural network architectures.
