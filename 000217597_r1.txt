Report 1 for paper "Machine Learning Methods That Economists Should Know About" 

⮚ What is the research question of the article?
The paper aims to explore how Machine Learning (ML) can be applied in the fields of economics and econometrics. In fact, the authors compare the objectives, methodologies, and contexts of ML with traditional econometrics and statistics literature, highlighting key machine learning methods crucial for empirical economics research.
⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
The document has both strengths and weaknesses. One strong aspect is how it blends theoretical concepts like supervised learning and others with practical applications in econometrics. This is beneficial for researchers and students because it shows how theory applies in real-world situations. Often, students learn a lot of economic theory but struggle to see how it's used in practice. This document helps bridge that gap by demonstrating real-life examples, making it easier for students to understand and apply these concepts effectively. On the other hand, an important weakness to note is the limited discussion on the challenges that researchers and students might encounter. Specifically, the paper could have provided a more detailed exploration of the obstacles and limitations associated with using machine learning methods in economics. By doing so, it would have offered a more balanced view of the subject.
⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
It's widely recognized how rapidly ML has been advancing in academic circles and its potential to make significant contributions across various job sectors. In this sense, by exploring how machine learning can be combined with econometrics, the paper enhances our understanding of how advanced computer methods can help solve tricky economic problems and make better decisions when we're not sure about the outcome.
